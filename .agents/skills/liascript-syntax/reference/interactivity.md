# Interactivity

LiaScript content becomes interactive through five layers that combine freely: **effects** (animation/narration/playback timing), **executable code blocks** (editable code with an Execute button and a terminal), the **`send`/JS API** every script gets, **macros** (text-substitution shortcuts, usually imported from a template course), and **JS-Components** (raw `<script>` tags embedded directly in the Markdown body). This file covers all five for *using* them in a course. For *building* a reusable macro/template package for the LiaTemplates ecosystem, see the separate `template-development` skill — it documents the 12 implementation patterns and the full `send` object from the author's side; this file only covers calling what already exists.

## Effects

Animations, comments, and playback are all defined with double curly braces `{{...}}` (or single braces `{...}` for inline use) placed above/around a block or span. They are revealed step-by-step with each click in `Presentation`/`Slides` mode; in `Textbook` mode every step is shown at once, each tagged with its step number.

**Block animation** — a `{{start-stop?}}` line directly above a block (indent by 4+ spaces so other Markdown tools show it as code); the block appears at `start` and, if given, disappears at `stop`:

```markdown
     {{1}}
This appears at step 1 and stays.

     {{2-3}}
This appears at step 2 and disappears at step 3.

{{4}} Same-line form: also valid, but harder to spot in other viewers.
```

**Inline animation** — wrap the animation definition and the affected text in two adjacent brace pairs, usable mid-sentence:

```markdown
* no effect here
* but in this line {2}{show ***second***}
* as well as this one {1-2}{show ***first*** remove on __second__}
```

**Multi-block animation** — group several Markdown blocks (paragraphs, tables, ...) under one step by surrounding them with lines of 3+ asterisks, with the animation definition above the opening line. Rendered and confirmed both forms: the asterisk-fence form below, and the alternative `<section>...</section>` wrapper (in place of the two asterisk lines) — both correctly revealed a paragraph and a table together as a single step, at the same time, with the animation definition placed above the block/tag either way. Note `***` has a second, unrelated meaning as the quiz solution-block delimiter — see `reference/quizzes-surveys.md`'s Tweaks section.

```markdown
     {{1-2}}
************************************

This is an example...

| that     | contains |
|----------|----------|
| multiple | blocks.  |

************************************
```

**Styling and nesting** — a multi-block animation may contain further block and inline animations. An attribute comment above the animation marker styles the revealed block; the bundled [animate.css](https://animate.style) classes give entrance effects:

```markdown
<!-- class="animate__animated animate__backInUp" -->
     {{1}}
This block flies in at step 1, with an {2}{inline part}<!-- class="animate__animated animate__flash" --> at step 2.
```

**TTS-sync comments** — a paragraph marked with `--{{n}}--` is read aloud by the document's text-to-speech engine when animation step `n` is reached, in `Presentation`/`Slides` mode. It is designed to be used *together with* a `{{n}}`-marked visual block at the same step number, not as an alternative to it: think of `{{n}}` as a presentation bullet point (the visual content revealed at that step) and `--{{n}}--` as the speaker notes for that same bullet (the spoken explanation of it). In `Textbook` mode the `--{{n}}--` paragraph is simply displayed as plain visible text in place — it is not hidden there (confirmed by rendering: the plain-text form is visible in Textbook mode with the surrounding document). `Presentation` and `Slides` do **not** behave identically here, despite both being non-`Textbook` modes: rendered and confirmed, `Presentation` mode truly hides the comment — wrapped in a visually-hidden CSS container (collapsed to a 1px sliver, present in the DOM/accessible text but not legible on screen) — while `Slides` mode shows it, but not in place: it renders in a separate, genuinely visible speaker-notes side panel docked at the edge of the viewport, not inline with the slide body (that panel's container carries a `hide-lg-down` responsive class, so this was only confirmed at a wide viewport — narrow-viewport/mobile behavior wasn't independently tested). For the full slide-construction pattern that combines `{{n}}` blocks and `--{{n}}--` comments into a presentation that also works as a textbook, see `reference/presentation-pattern.md`.

```markdown
     {{1}}
**Photosynthesis converts light into sugar.**

          --{{1}}--
This is the narration for that same step — spoken aloud when step 1
is reached, explaining what's already visible on screen.
```

**`--{{n}}--` is the narration half of the `{{n}}`/`--{{n}}--` pair — it does not, by itself, create a visual reveal.** A common mistake is using `--{{n}}--` alone, expecting the paragraph it wraps to appear on screen at that step the way a `{{n}}`-marked paragraph would. It does not: in `Presentation` mode that paragraph is hidden entirely (narration-only, via the visually-hidden CSS technique described above); in `Slides` mode it does appear, but only in the separate speaker-notes side panel, never inline in the main slide body the way a `{{n}}`-marked fragment would (it does show as plain text in place in `Textbook` mode — see above); either way it never produces the visual reveal a `{{n}}`-marked paragraph would, and this fails silently — there's no error that flags the *markup* as wrong. You may see unrelated TTS/EasySpeech console errors (see below) as a side effect of the browser attempting to speak text it now thinks is narration, but nothing in those errors points at the real problem — a missing visual reveal. Confirmed by rendering: a paragraph marked `--{{1}}--` with no accompanying `{{1}}` block never appeared on screen at step 0, 1, or 2 in `Presentation` mode, while the same paragraph marked with bare `{{1}}` rendered normally and became visible exactly at its step. Adding to the confusion risk: `---` (3+ dashes) is the horizontal-rule/section-break marker (see `reference/syntax-core.md`), and `--` on its own, mid-text, is typographic — it renders as an en dash, not a rule (also `reference/syntax-core.md`). Neither of those creates a visual reveal either, but both make `--{{n}}--` look like a plausible standalone "dashed fragment" variant when it is really the narration side of a pair.

```markdown
     {{1}}
This is a real fragment/bullet point. It appears at step 1 and stays
visible from then on, in every presentation mode.

          --{{1}}--
This is the narration for step 1 — pair it with the {{1}} block
above, don't use it alone expecting a visual reveal.
```

Wrap the comment in an HTML comment (`<!-- --{{n}}-- ... -->`) to keep it out of Textbook mode too — a "hidden" comment, spoken but never shown. Rendered and confirmed: a plain `--{{n}}--` comment's text is visible in Textbook mode, while the exact same comment wrapped in `<!-- -->` produces no visible text anywhere, in any mode, even though it occupies a real animation step (a later step still advances past it correctly).

Several comments with the same step number are read in document order and combined; only the first one's voice is used.

**Voices** — the voice can be set on three levels:

1. **Course:** `narrator:` in the main header (default if missing: `US English Male`).
2. **Slide:** a `narrator:` in an HTML comment directly below the slide heading overrides it for that slide.
3. **Comment:** `--{{n voice}}--` overrides it for one comment, e.g. `--{{3 Deutsch Female}}--`.

Custom voice aliases are defined as macros and used with `@`:

```markdown
## Slide Title
<!--
narrator: UK English Female
@Tanja:   Russian Female
-->

    --{{1}}--
Spoken with the slide's UK English Female voice.

    --{{2 Deutsch Female}}--
Dieser Kommentar wird mit einer deutschen Stimme gesprochen.

    --{{3 @Tanja}}--
«Для торжества зла достаточно бездействия хороших людей».
```

Voice names follow the ResponsiveVoice naming scheme (`<Language> Female`/`<Language> Male`, e.g. `UK English Female`, `Deutsch Male`, `French Female`, `Arabic Male`); the full list is in the docs' `narrator` section. LiaScript uses the browser/OS speech engine first and picks the best-matching installed voice (with fallbacks to related languages); ResponsiveVoice is the backup engine. Pick a voice whose language matches the course's `language` field.

**Speech rate and pitch** — an attribute comment above a comment or playback element changes how it is spoken: `data-pitch` from `0` to `2`, `data-rate` from `0.1` to `5`:

```markdown
<!-- data-rate="1.5" data-pitch="1.2" -->
    --{{1}}--
This is read faster and slightly higher.
```

**Translation** — users can translate a course with Google Translate from the settings. Code blocks and comments with a non-default voice (foreign-language text) are never translated; LiaScript then looks for a voice matching the new language. To exclude any other block or inline element, attach both attributes (Google uses the class, other tools the attribute):

```markdown
<!-- class="notranslate" translate="no" -->
    --{{2}}--
I will not be translated!
```

**Recorded audio or video instead of TTS (optional)** — a comment that starts or ends with an audio or video link plays that recording instead of speaking the text when the step is reached:

```markdown
    --{{1}}--
?[⏯](recording/audio_1.mp3)
The recording replaces the TTS output for this step.

    --{{2}}--
!?[⏯](recording/video_2.webm#t=4,12)
The video is shown as an overlay the viewer can move and resize.
```

- The link is not rendered as a normal inline player. Audio is only fetched and played when the step is reached; a video appears as a movable overlay.
- `#t=start,end` (in seconds) plays only that part of the file.
- `data-rate` also applies to recordings; `data-pitch` does not.
- If the user translates the course with Google Translate, translated comments are spoken with TTS in the target language instead of playing the recording.

**Playback** — `{{|>}}` (block) or `{|>}{...}` (inline) attaches a visible Play/Pause button that reads the paragraph aloud on click, independent of the animation step machinery and visible in every presentation mode (unlike TTS-sync comments, which never appear inline outside Textbook mode — see above):

```markdown
    {{|>}}
This entire paragraph will be spoken out __LOUD__.

    {{!> Australian Female}}
* But in this case, this can also be combined
* with a couple of
* - different
  - Markdown elements
```

`{{!> voice}}`/`{!> voice}{...}` picks a specific voice for that one playback button. `|>` and `!>` are interchangeable — use `!>` inside tables, where `|` would break the table syntax.

**Playback blocks** — put `{{|>}}` above a `***` fence (or a `<section>`/`<div>`) to read several blocks with one button.

**Inline playback** — `{|>}{text}` or `{!> voice}{text}` adds a play button to a word or phrase; ideal for vocabulary tables in language courses:

```markdown
| English      | German                        |
| ------------ | ----------------------------- |
| {!>}{I go}   | {!> Deutsch Male}{ich gehe}   |
| {!>}{you go} | {!> Deutsch Male}{du gehst}   |
```

**Playback combined with animation** — add the step range: `{{1 |>}}` for a block, `{|> 1-2}{...}` inline. The button appears at that step, and what is read depends on which inline parts are currently visible (in Textbook mode everything is shown and read):

```markdown
    {{1 |>}}
This is an example where {|> 1-2}{I go} _{|> 2}{I am going}_ to work.
```

**Play buttons without visible text** — TTS and translation need the text in the DOM, so `display: none` does not work. Shift the text off-screen instead, best via a macro in the slide's header comment:

```markdown
<!--
@play: {!> @0}{<span style="display: inline-block; text-indent: -10000px">@1</span>}
@de: @play(Deutsch Male,@0)
-->

| I | @de(ich gehe) |
```

## Interactive Code Blocks

**Starting simple** — attach a `<script>@input</script>` tag directly below a fenced code block to make it executable: an Execute button and (after the first run) a terminal panel appear below the editor. `@input` is replaced with the block's current (editable) content before the script runs; the script's last expression is the returned/displayed value.

````markdown
``` javascript
var result = 0
for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) { result += i }
result
```
<script>@input</script>
````

Each run of edited code is saved as a new version; the user can step back and forth between versions (editing an older version appends a new one).

**Multi-file projects** — several fenced code blocks placed back-to-back with *no blank line between them* become one project with one shared `<script>` tag at the end. Give each block a filename after the language (prefix `-` to start hidden/minimized, `+` — the default — to start visible), and reference an individual block from the script with `@input(n)` (0-indexed; `@input` alone is equivalent to `@input(0)`):

````markdown
``` js     -EvalScript.js
let who = data.first_name + " " + data.last_name;
if (data.online) { who + " is online"; } else { who + " is NOT online"; }
```
``` json   +Data.json
{ "first_name": "Sammy", "last_name": "Shark", "online": true }
```
<script>
  let data = @input(1);
  @input(0)
</script>
````

**Default `@output`** — add `@output` as an attribute in the *last* code block's fence header (` ```text @output `) inside a project to designate its content as the default output, shown immediately on load, before the project has ever been executed. This is a fence-header attribute, not a standalone directive line and not something you can attach to a single non-project code block — confirmed by rendering: the placeholder text from the `@output` block appears in the terminal panel as soon as the slide loads, and is replaced by the script's real return value only after clicking Execute.

````markdown
``` js     -EvalScript.js
let who = data.first_name + " " + data.last_name;
if (data.online) { who + " is online"; } else { who + " is NOT online"; }
```
``` json   +Data.json
{ "first_name": "Sammy", "last_name": "Shark", "online": true }
```
``` text @output
Is Sammy Shark really online?
```
<script>
  let data = @input(1);
  @input(0)
</script>
````

This is useful for a course a student may be running offline (no external interpreter available) or for a plain-Markdown viewer like GitHub, where the code never actually executes.

**Loading external resources** — a library referenced from inside a `<script>` tag must be loaded via the `script:` meta-header field first (`<script>` tags themselves cannot fetch external JS); once loaded it is available globally to every code block on the page:

````markdown
<!--
script: https://cdn.example.com/library.min.js
-->

``` matlab
f = sin(t)^4 - 2*cos(t/2)^3*sin(t)
```
<script> Algebrite.run(`@input`) </script>
````

**Styling** — attributes go in an HTML comment directly above the fence. Rendered and confirmed working: `data-showGutter="false"` removes the line-number gutter (checked directly against the Ace editor instance); `data-theme="chaos"` (any Ace theme name) switches the editor's color theme; `data-marker="y1 x1 y2 x2 color type;"` (repeatable, `;`-separated) highlights a row/column range with a color keyword (`error`/`log`/`warn`/`debug`/`info`, or a spaceless `rgba(...)`) and an optional marker type (`text`, `fullLine` default, `screenLine`) — confirmed via the actual marker DOM nodes and their color classes. Further attributes and their defaults: `data-tabSize="2"`, `data-fontSize="12pt"` (must be given in `pt`), `data-firstLineNumber="0"`. By default, non-executable code blocks show no line numbers (useful for pseudo-code), executable ones do. **`data-readOnly="true"` did not take effect in testing** — tried on a standalone scripted block, as a bare `data-readOnly` attribute, and inside a two-file project (the exact form shown in the official docs); in all three cases the Ace editor's `getReadOnly()` still reported `false` and typing into the editor was accepted. Treat `data-readOnly` as unverified/possibly version-dependent rather than a reliable way to lock a block from editing.

## The send/JS API

Every `<script>` — whether attached to a code block via `@input`, standalone in the body, or driving a quiz/survey/task — gets a local `send` object plus global `console.*` shortcuts for talking back to LiaScript:

```js
// Control strings — as the script's last expression, or via send.lia(...)
"LIA: stop"       // finish, no further output shown for this run
"LIA: wait"       // keep the loading/running indicator active (for async work)
"LIA: terminal"   // open an interactive input line below the output (a REPL)
"LIA: clear"      // clear the terminal panel

send.lia("message")           // push output, keep running
send.lia("message", [], true) // push output, mark as success (green)
send.lia("message", [], false)// push output, mark as failure (red)
send.lia("LIA: stop")         // push output and stop in one call

send.lia("LIASCRIPT:\n## Heading\n...")  // parsed as LiaScript markup
send.lia("HTML: <b>bold</b>")            // injected as raw HTML
send.liascript(`## Dynamic content`)     // shorthand for the LIASCRIPT: prefix

console.debug(...)   // gray debug line
console.warn(...)    // yellow warning
console.log(...)     // plain info line
console.error(...)   // red error line
console.html(str)    // inject raw HTML into the terminal
console.stream(str)  // append without a trailing newline
console.clear()      // shorthand for send.lia("LIA: clear")
console.table(data)  // also: console.assert, console.count/countReset,
                     //       console.time/timeLog/timeEnd (performance measurement)

send.log("warn", "", ["This is a warning", 12, [1,2,3]])
                     // generic form: send.log(type, separator, contentList),
                     // type = "debug" | "info" | "warn" | "error" | "html" | "stream"

// Terminal I/O, once "LIA: terminal" is active
send.handle("input", input => { /* runs on each line the user submits */ })
send.handle("stop",  e     => { /* runs when the user clicks stop */ })

// Cross-block pub/sub
send.register("event-name", callback)
send.dispatch("event-name", payload)
```

Verified behavior worth calling out:

- **Async pattern** — end the run with `"LIA: wait"`, and call `send.lia(...)` (with `"LIA: stop"` at the end, or as a separate call) once the async work finishes. Rendered and confirmed: the Execute button hides while waiting, `console.warn`/`send.lia` output from inside a `setTimeout` callback appears once it fires, and the Execute button reappears once `"LIA: stop"` is sent.
- **`"LIA: terminal"` + `send.handle`** — rendered and confirmed: after Execute, a small input editor plus a "Send to terminal" button appear; typing `2+2` and sending it runs the registered `input` handler (`eval(input)` in the test) and prints `4`.
- **`send.register`/`send.dispatch`** — confirmed working for two code blocks that both live **on the same slide**: block A's terminal input dispatched an event that block B's registered listener received and logged, and vice versa. Cross-*slide* delivery (the official docs' claim that this also works "even if both code blocks are defined on different slides") did **not** reproduce in testing here: after executing a listener on slide B, navigating away, then executing and dispatching from slide A, no callback fired on B — LiaScript unmounts a slide's scripts (and, apparently, their registered listeners) when you navigate away from it, unless something keeps that slide's DOM alive (e.g. the `persistent: true` meta-header/slide-header field). If you rely on cross-slide messaging, keep the receiving slide `persistent` or verify your specific case rather than assuming it works out of the box.
- **Multi-line terminal input** — in `"LIA: terminal"` mode, <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> inserts a new line; Enter (or the send button) submits.
- **Error annotations in the editor** — pass line-specific details as the second argument of `send.lia` (one inner list per code block of the project), or throw a `LiaError`:

  ```js
  send.lia("ups, something went wrong",
    [[{ row: 1, column: 1, text: "insert your error info here", type: "error" },
      { row: 2, column: 1, text: "a warning about this line",   type: "warning" }]],
    false)
  "LIA: stop"

  // or, equivalently:
  var error = new LiaError("ups something went wrong", 1)   // 1 = number of code blocks
  error.add_detail(0, "insert your error info here", "error", 1, 1)  // block, text, type, row, column
  throw error
  ```
- **`send.output`** is for standalone JS-Component `<script>` tags (see below), not for `<script>@input</script>` code-block scripts — see the JS-Components section for the verified distinction.

## Using Macros

A macro is `@Name` or `@Name(args)` anywhere in the document body (or `@Name`/`@Name: ...` in a meta-header block), expanded at parse time from a definition — either written locally in this course's header, or pulled in from another course entirely with `import:`:

````markdown
<!--
import: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liaTemplates/ABCjs/main/README.md
-->

``` abc  @ABCJS.render
X: 1
T: Test Tune
M: C
L: 1/8
K: F
"F"[A3F3][AF] ([AF][GE][AF])[BG] |
```
````

`import:` (repeatable, one URL per line) loads only the *main header* of the referenced course — its macros, `script:`/`link:` entries, `attribute:` lines, and `@onload` block — not its body content. Rendered and confirmed both halves of this claim with a small local two-course fixture: importing the [LiaTemplates ABCjs](https://github.com/liaTemplates/ABCjs) template and calling `@ABCJS.render` on a fenced `abc` code block produces a fully interactive sheet-music rendering with working playback controls, no console errors (confirms the macro/header *is* loaded); separately, importing a second local course whose header defined one macro and whose body had two of its own slide headings, the importing course's table of contents listed only its own sections — the imported course's slide titles never appeared, confirming the body is *not* pulled in. Prefer pinning a specific tag/commit in the `import:` URL over `master`/`main` for a course that needs to keep working unmodified.

**Defining macros** — in the main header or in a slide's header comment (a slide-level definition overrides a main-header macro of the same name, e.g. to change `narrator` or `author` for one section). Macro names are case-sensitive (`@author` ≠ `@Author`); the leading `@` in a definition is optional but recommended.

```markdown
<!--
@smile: ;-)
@Single.line: a single-line macro may continue
  on further lines, as long as they are indented.

@block
Block macros keep whitespace and newlines and may contain
Markdown, HTML, CSS, or JavaScript — and call other macros: @smile
@end

@@commented: a single-line macro commented out with @@
@@@commented-block
a block macro commented out with @@@
@end
-->
```

Two special block macros in the main header: `@onload ... @end` holds JavaScript that runs once before the course is shown (global helper functions, setup), and `@style ... @end` holds CSS that is applied directly while parsing (faster than an external `link:`, and not passed on when the course is imported). To write a literal `@` that must not be expanded, escape it: `\@`.

**Calling a macro with parameters** — parentheses, comma-separated, positional (`@0`, `@1`, ... inside the definition). Rendered and confirmed with a two-parameter macro (`@highlight: <b style="color: @0">@1</b>`, called as `@highlight(red, simple text)` → a real, interpreted `<b style="color: red">simple text</b>`, not escaped text):

```markdown
@highlight(red, simple text)
```

A parameter that itself contains commas must be wrapped in backticks, otherwise it is split at the first comma:

```markdown
@highlight(green, `simply, simply, green`)
```

A multi-line parameter can be passed inline by wrapping it in a triple-backtick block inside the parentheses (``@highlight(green, ```...```)``) — this works but reads badly in other Markdown viewers, so prefer a code-block parameter:

**Code-block parameter** — put the macro call in the fence's info string, after the language tag; the block's *content* becomes the macro's **last** parameter (the language tag only drives syntax highlighting in other viewers):

````markdown
``` json @panorama("0",https://pannellum.org/images/cerro-toco-0.jpg)
{ "pitch": 14.1, "yaw": 1.5, "type": "info", "text": "Baltimore Museum of Art" }
```
````

**Link parameter** — `@[MacroName(other, args)](relative/or/absolute/url "optional title")`: the URL is passed as the last parameter, and a relative URL is resolved to an absolute one first. Because the call is shaped like a normal Markdown link, it still renders as a clickable link on GitHub and in other viewers.

**Escaping for use inside a JS string** — prefix with `'`: `@'input`, `@'input(1)`, `@'0`, or `@'MacroName(...)` backslash-escape the substituted value so it's safe to embed inside a JS template literal, per the official docs. Apply it once only; chaining escaped macros can double-escape special characters.

**Debugging a call** without running it — prefix with an extra `@` (`@@MyMacro(args)`) to dump its fully expanded output into a gray, read-only block instead of executing it. Rendered and confirmed: `@@highlight(red, dump this call)` produced a gray `<pre><code>` block showing the (HTML-escaped) expansion instead of a live bold-red span.

For *authoring* your own macros/templates — the block/single-line macro syntax, `@uid`, the 12 established implementation patterns for wrapping a JS library, `LiaError` for editor annotations, and the full template file layout — see the `template-development` skill; that content is not duplicated here.

## JS-Components

A bare `<script>...</script>` tag placed directly in the document body (no fenced code block, no `@input`, no Execute button) is a **standalone JS-Component**: it runs automatically wherever it appears, as an inline element like `**bold**` or an inline formula, and its final expression's value is displayed in place of the tag (an `undefined` result, e.g. from a bare `alert(...)` call, displays nothing, making the script effectively invisible). Rendered and confirmed: `<script>2+2</script>` inline in a sentence displays `4` in place; a script whose last statement is a plain `var` assignment (`undefined`) displays nothing at all.

```markdown
$ \sin(\frac{\pi}{2}) = $ <script>Math.sin(Math.PI / 2)</script>
```

Every script — code-block or standalone — runs in its own local scope; two `<script>` tags cannot see each other's plain `var`/`let` bindings. To share state, attach it to `window` explicitly. Rendered and confirmed: `window.a = 22 ** 3` in one script followed by `window.a / 2` in a second, separate script correctly produced `10648` then `5324` — the second script read the value the first one attached to `window`.

```markdown
<script> window.a = 22 ** 3 </script>
<script> window.a / 2 </script>
```

If a script throws, the error message is displayed as its result.

Scripts combine with animation numbers the same way any block does (`{{1}} <script>...</script>`) to delay execution until that step is reached; in `Textbook` mode all of a slide's scripts run once the slide loads. A script without an animation number runs whenever the slide is opened — again on every visit (use `run-once` to prevent that, see Script attributes below).

**Returning HTML or LiaScript** — a plain string result is shown as text. Prefix it with `HTML:` to render it as HTML, or with `LIASCRIPT:` to have it parsed as LiaScript (tables, formulas, even quizzes). Scripts render inline by default; `style="display: block"` gives them the full line. Quizzes/code generated this way are not persisted — only elements written directly in the Markdown keep their state.

```markdown
<script run-once>"LIASCRIPT: $$\\frac{1}{x} = 0$$"</script>

<script style="display: block" modify="false">
"HTML: <marquee>This text scrolls</marquee>"
</script>
```

**Script attributes:**

| Attribute | Effect |
|---|---|
| `run-once` | Execute only once; the result is kept and shown on every later appearance. |
| `modify="false"` | Disables editing the script by double-click and removes the gray background. |
| `modify="// pattern\n"` | Only the code between two `// pattern` lines is shown/editable on double-click; the rest stays hidden. Combine with `type` (e.g. `type="text/python"`) for highlighting when executing other languages from a string. |
| `worker="true"` | Run in a web worker (for heavy computation) — no DOM access. |
| `update-on-change` / `="false"` | Re-run on every change vs. only on Enter/blur, overriding the input type's default. |
| `input-active` | The input widget is visible on first appearance (normally it appears only after clicking the script), and closes again on blur. |
| `input-always-active` | The input widget stays visible permanently. |
| `style="display: block"` | Render the script result as a block instead of inline. |


**Asynchronous execution & `send.output`** — this is where the standalone form and the code-block form genuinely diverge, confirmed by testing both: `send.output(...)` only produces visible, live-updating output from a **standalone** `<script>` tag (no fence, no `@input`); the same `send.output` call inside a `<script>@input</script>` code-block script does not surface anything in the terminal panel. For a long-running/self-updating standalone script, return `"LIA: wait"` (or call `send.wait()`) so LiaScript knows the process is still active, then call `send.output(...)` on every update — this does not reset the run the way `send.lia(...)` would:

```markdown
<script>
setInterval(function(){
  i++
  send.output("counting " + i)
}, 1000)

var i = 0
"LIA: wait"
</script>
```

Rendered and confirmed: the inline text updates live ("counting 1", "counting 2", ...) without any Execute button. Also specifically confirmed by navigating away to a different slide and back: the counter kept incrementing the whole time it was off-screen (it read a much higher count on return than when last seen) and a `window`-level run-counter variable stayed at its original value — i.e. revisiting the slide did **not** re-run the script's setup code or reset the interval, it just re-attached the display to the still-running background process. This holds until `send.stop()`/`send.lia("LIA: stop")` is called. Shortcuts: `send.wait()` = `"LIA: wait"`, `send.stop()` = `"LIA: stop"`, `send.clear()` = `"LIA: clear"`.

**Input types** — add `input="<type>"` (plus `value="..."` for the initial value) to a `<script>` tag to turn it into a small interactive widget wired to `@input`; most HTML5 input types are supported: `text` (the default for a bare `input` attribute), `number`, `range`, `checkbox`, `radio`, `select`, `button`, `submit`, `search`, `password`, `email`, `url`, `tel`, `color`, `date`, `datetime-local`, `time`, `month`, `week`, `hidden`, and `textarea` (`file` and `image` are not supported). `text`/`number`/`range`/`radio`/`checkbox` re-run the script on every change, most others once the field loses focus or Enter is pressed — `update-on-change` overrides this. A `checkbox` with `options="Ben|Jerry"` becomes a multi-select returning a JSON list. Rendered and confirmed for the most commonly used types:

```markdown
<script input="text" value="reverse">
let str = "@input"
str.split("").reverse().join("")
</script>

<script input="number" value="1" min="0" max="1000000">
let i = @input
"Square of " + i + " = " + i * i
</script>

<script input="range" value="0" min="0" max="360" step="0.1">
let i = @input
"Sinus of " + i + " = " + Math.sin(i)
</script>

<script input="checkbox" value="true">
"@input"
</script>

<script input="radio" value="1" options="1|2|3|Hello World">
"Selected option: @input"
</script>

<script input="select" value="1" options="1|2|3|Hello World">
"Selected option: @input"
</script>

<script input="button">
"click me"
</script>

<script input="submit" default="click me">
Math.random()
</script>
```

`options` (`radio`/`select`, `|`-separated) and `default` (`submit`/`button` — the value shown before the first click) are LiaScript-specific, not standard HTML attributes. Confirmed distinctions: `text`/`number`/`range`/`radio`/`select`/`checkbox` execute immediately on load with their default `value`; `button` also executes on load and again on every click; `submit` does **not** execute on load — it shows its `default` text until clicked, and only then runs the script (verified: clicking replaced the static `"click me"` with a fresh `Math.random()` result each time).

**Connecting scripts via `output`/`input`** — give a script `output="channel-name"`, then reference its live, currently-displayed value from any other script (same slide) with `` @input(`channel-name`) `` (backticks required around the channel name):

```markdown
<script input="checkbox" value="true" output="P" default="true">
@input
</script>
AND
<script input="checkbox" value="false" output="Q" default="false">
@input
</script>
<script>
@input(`P`) && @input(`Q`)
</script>
```

Rendered and confirmed: toggling either checkbox live-updates the combining script's `true`/`false` result. If two scripts reference each other's output (a cycle), give both a `default` value or the first calculation has nothing to read and errors out — rendered and confirmed both sides of this specifically: two async scripts with `output`/`` @input(`other`) `` pointing at each other and a `default` on both settled cleanly to a computed value with no console errors; the identical pair with `default` removed from both instead threw an uncaught `TypeError` in the console on load and displayed nothing.

**Internationalization API** — `format="..."` (`number`, `datetime`, `list`, `relativetime`, `pluralrules`) applies a `locale`-aware `Intl.*` formatter to the script's output for display only (the underlying `@input` value used by connected scripts is unaffected). Confirmed: `format="number" locale="de-DE"` renders `1234.5` as `1.234,5` (German grouping/decimal separator), and `format="datetime" locale="de"` renders a `date`-type input in the German date format. The docs additionally describe a `localeStyle` parameter (used instead of `style`, since `style` is reserved for inline CSS) for `Intl.NumberFormat`'s `style` option (e.g. `localeStyle="currency" currency="EUR"`) — this did not visibly change the rendered output in testing here (both `localeStyle="currency"` and a plain `style="currency"` attempt produced the same locale-formatted number with no currency symbol), so treat currency-style formatting as unverified and check it against your target LiaScript version before relying on it.

**`LIA` global object** — `window.LIA` exposes a few helpers to scripts:

```js
LIA.fetch(url, options)   // like fetch(), but resolves URLs relative to the course
LIA.goto(5)               // jump to the slide with this index
LIA.gotoNext(); LIA.gotoPrevious()
LIA.settings              // read/change the user settings from JavaScript
LIA.debug = true          // log every script error to the browser console
LIA.focusOnMain = false   // don't move the focus to the main content on slide change
LIA.scrollUpOnMain = false// don't scroll to the top on slide change
```

`LIA.classroom` is a publish/subscribe interface for the live-presentation "Classroom" feature (peer-to-peer, active only while a classroom session is connected):

```js
LIA.classroom.connected                 // bool: is a classroom session active
LIA.classroom.on("connect", () => {})
LIA.classroom.on("disconnect", () => {})
LIA.classroom.publish("topic", payload)
const id = LIA.classroom.subscribe("topic", message => {})
LIA.classroom.unsubscribe(id)
```

Confirmed only that `LIA.classroom.connected` is safely accessible and reads `false` outside of an active classroom session — the object exists and does not throw even with no session connected; the publish/subscribe round-trip itself needs a live multi-peer classroom to exercise and was not independently re-verified here.
